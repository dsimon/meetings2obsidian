# Meetings2Obsidian

A command-line tool that downloads AI-generated meeting summaries from multiple platforms (Heypocket, Google Meet, Zoom) and formats them for Obsidian note-taking.

## Features

- **Multi-platform support**: Sync meetings from Heypocket, Google Meet, and Zoom
- **Obsidian-ready formatting**: Automatic markdown formatting with custom YAML frontmatter template
- **Duplicate prevention**: Tracks downloaded meetings to avoid duplicates
- **Flexible configuration**: YAML-based configuration with platform-specific settings
- **API integration**: Direct API access for Heypocket
- **Browser automation**: Persistent browser sessions for Zoom and Google Meet — login persists between runs via shared Chrome profile
- **Google Drive integration**: Google Meet sync discovers Gemini-generated meeting notes from Google Drive (no scraping required)
- **Incremental sync**: Only downloads new meetings since last sync
- **Timezone conversion**: Automatically converts all timestamps from UTC to local timezone
- **Custom frontmatter**: Structured metadata with type, date, time, attendees, meeting-type, ai platform tags, and links

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- macOS or Linux
- Obsidian vault

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd meetings2obsidian
```

### 2. Configure the application

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
nano config.yaml  # or use your preferred editor
```

### 3. Run

```bash
./meetings2obsidian.sh
```

On first run, the script automatically:
- Creates a `.venv` virtual environment
- Installs Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Downloads the Playwright Chromium browser

Subsequent runs skip setup and sync immediately.

## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize settings:

### Required Settings

```yaml
# Path to your Obsidian vault
obsidian_vault_path: /path/to/your/obsidian/vault

# Folder within vault to save meeting notes
output_folder: Meetings
```

### Platform Settings

#### Heypocket (API-based)

```yaml
platforms:
  heypocket:
    enabled: true
    api_key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

Get your API key from the Heypocket dashboard.

#### Google Meet (Browser automation + Google Drive)

```yaml
platforms:
  googlemeet:
    enabled: true
    browser:
      # Optional: defaults to ~/.meetings2obsidian/chrome_profile/
      # which persists your Google session between runs.
      # Shared with Zoom — both platforms use the same profile.
      user_data_dir: null
```

Google Meet sync discovers Gemini-generated meeting notes from Google Drive — both notes in your own "Meet Recordings" folder and shared "Notes by Gemini" documents. On first run, log into Google in the browser window that opens. Your session is saved to `~/.meetings2obsidian/chrome_profile/` and reused on subsequent runs.

You can also point `user_data_dir` at an existing Chrome profile:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/google-chrome/Default`

#### Zoom (Browser automation)

```yaml
platforms:
  zoom:
    enabled: true
    browser:
      # Optional: defaults to ~/.meetings2obsidian/chrome_profile/
      # which persists your Zoom session between runs.
      # Shared with Google Meet — both platforms use the same profile.
      user_data_dir: null
```

Zoom uses browser automation to extract AI-generated meeting summaries. On first run, you'll need to log into Zoom in the browser window that opens. Your session is saved to `~/.meetings2obsidian/chrome_profile/` so you won't need to log in again.

See [ZOOM_SETUP.md](ZOOM_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Usage

### Run all syncs

```bash
./meetings2obsidian.sh
```

### Run specific platform

```bash
# Heypocket only
.venv/bin/python src/heypocket_sync.py

# Google Meet only
.venv/bin/python src/googlemeet_sync.py

# Zoom only
.venv/bin/python src/zoom_sync.py
```

### Command-line options

```bash
# Use custom config file
./meetings2obsidian.sh --config /path/to/config.yaml

# Only fetch meetings since a specific date
./meetings2obsidian.sh --since 2024-01-01

# Dry run (see what would be downloaded without saving)
./meetings2obsidian.sh --dry-run

# Verbose logging
./meetings2obsidian.sh --verbose

# Combine options
./meetings2obsidian.sh --since 2024-01-15 --dry-run --verbose
```

### Individual module options

All modules support the same command-line options:

```bash
.venv/bin/python src/heypocket_sync.py --config config.yaml --since 2024-01-01 --dry-run --verbose
```

## Output Format

Meeting notes are saved as markdown files with the following format:

### File naming

```text
{date} - {title}.md
```

Example: `2024-01-25 - Weekly Team Sync.md`

**Note**: All dates and times are automatically converted from UTC to your local timezone.

### File content

```markdown
---
type: ainote
date: 2024-01-25
time: 14:30
attendees:
  - Alice Johnson
  - Bob Smith
  - Carol Williams
meeting-type: []
ai:
  - zoom
link: ""
tags:
  - meeting
  - zoom
  - team-sync

```

## State Management

The tool maintains a SQLite database (`meetings_state.db`) to track:
- Downloaded meetings (prevents duplicates)
- Last sync timestamp per platform
- Meeting metadata and file locations

This database is created automatically on first run.

## Troubleshooting

### "Config file not found" error

Make sure you've created `config.yaml` from the example:
```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
```

### Browser automation not working (Zoom / Google Meet)

1. On first run, log into Google/Zoom in the browser window that opens
2. Sessions are saved to `~/.meetings2obsidian/chrome_profile/` — delete this folder to force re-login
3. If you set a custom `user_data_dir`, verify the path is correct
4. Make sure Playwright is installed: `playwright install chromium`
5. Close Chrome before running if you're sharing a Chrome profile

### Zoom browser automation issues

1. On first run, log into Zoom in the browser window that opens
2. If your login session expires, delete `~/.meetings2obsidian/chrome_profile/` and re-run
3. If summaries aren't captured, try `--verbose` to see debug output
4. Ensure Zoom AI Companion is enabled in your Zoom account settings

### Heypocket API errors

1. Verify your API key is correct in `config.yaml`
2. Check that your API key has the necessary permissions
3. Check for rate limiting (wait a few minutes and try again)
4. If you see "No summary available" in your Obsidian notes:
   - The tool extracts summaries from the `v2_summary.markdown` field
   - Ensure your Heypocket recordings have AI-generated summaries enabled
   - Use `--verbose` flag to see debug information about what fields are available
   - Check the Heypocket dashboard to confirm summaries are being generated

### Obsidian vault path errors

1. Ensure the path in `config.yaml` exists
2. Use absolute paths, not relative paths
3. Check that you have write permissions to the vault

### No meetings found

1. Check that you have meetings in the specified time range
2. Try running with `--verbose` to see detailed logs
3. For browser automation, ensure you're logged in to the platform

## Development

### Running tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Linting & Formatting

```bash
ruff check src/               # Lint
ruff format --check src/       # Check formatting
```

### Adding a new platform

1. Create a new module in `src/` (e.g., `teams_sync.py`)
2. Implement the sync logic following the existing pattern
3. Add platform configuration to `config.yaml`
4. Update the wrapper script to include the new platform

## Limitations

- Browser automation (Zoom, Google Meet) depends on current page structure, which may change
- Heypocket requires a valid API key
- Meeting summaries are only available if the platform's AI feature generates them
- Rate limits may apply depending on the platform

## Future Enhancements

See REQUIREMENTS.md for planned future enhancements (out of scope for initial version):
- GUI interface
- Real-time sync/daemon mode
- Integration with other meeting platforms (Teams, Webex)
- Custom template support
- Notification system
